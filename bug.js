While developing an Expo application, I encountered an unusual error where the application would crash intermittently without any specific error messages in the console.  The crashes occurred seemingly at random, making debugging very difficult. The Expo Go app on my Android device would simply close unexpectedly. The behavior was inconsistent, sometimes running for hours without issue and crashing after a few minutes at other times.  I've checked for memory leaks, but found none. The application's complexity is relatively low, using basic components and state management, so I was surprised by this erratic behavior.
