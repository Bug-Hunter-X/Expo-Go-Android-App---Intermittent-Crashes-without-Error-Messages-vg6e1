# Expo Go Android App - Intermittent Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in an Expo application running on Android using Expo Go. The application crashes intermittently without providing any specific error messages in the console. The crashes are inconsistent, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description
The Expo Go app crashes unpredictably. Sometimes it runs for extended periods without issues, while other times it crashes within minutes.  There are no clear error messages or logs to indicate the cause.

## Bug Reproduction
The `bug.js` file contains a simplified version of the code exhibiting the issue. While not directly reproducing the crash in this simplified form, it represents the structure of the application where the problem occurred. Running this code may not consistently crash but should give you a basic app that mimics where the bug was originally detected.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows a potential solution.  Note that this solution may depend on the underlying cause, which was not immediately apparent. In this case, thorough review and restructuring of asynchronous operations, especially those involving network requests or local storage access, was eventually identified as the solution.  The solution implemented more robust error handling and a more structured asynchronous flow.
